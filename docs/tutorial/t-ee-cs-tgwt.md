title: Case Study: The Great Wealth Transfer (EE)
---

North America is experiencing the largest wealth transfer in history.

According to a study from consulting firm Accenture, baby boomers have started to pass along their life savings to their heirs, and this process will continue over the next few decades. When done, some $30 trillion will be transferred from one generation to the next. (Source)

As our parents and grandparents pass away, their money, land, and other assets are being transferred to their children and grandchildren. Interestingly enough, a lot of grandparents are giving their money to charity instead of their children.

Financial Advisors are going to make a KILLING by charging 2% of every dollar transferred.
