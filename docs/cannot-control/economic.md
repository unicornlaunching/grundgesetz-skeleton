### In many countries, the economic / financial environment is heavily influenced by the political environment in the context of government rules and regulations as to how businesses make money, as well as how businesses are taxed.
### The Economic / Financial environment includes considerations such as the:
- GDP Gross Domestic Product
- the financial health of a region
- are companies making profits able to hire a lot of workers, so employees have money and they can spend this money on consumer items
- currency exchange rate
- can the currency of the country be used to purchase required imports
- currency convertability (relates to "economic sovereignty")
- rate of inflation / deflation
- rate of minimum wage
- ability of the government to finance infrastructure
- fiscal policy (the government's use of taxation)
- monetary policy (the money supply)
- national balance of payments
- deficit / surplus
- is the region attracting investment
